The project you are working on, "Orion Path," is an AI-powered learning platform. It's built using React, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and leverages Supabase for its backend services, including user authentication, database management, and serverless functions (Edge Functions).

The core functionality of Orion Path involves:

Course Creation: Users can define new courses by specifying a topic, context, and desired learning depth. This triggers an AI-driven process to generate a comprehensive syllabus.
Content Generation: Beyond the syllabus, the platform also supports AI-powered generation of detailed learning content for individual topics within a course.
Course Enrollment: Users can enroll in available courses, whether created by themselves or other community members.
Learning Progress Tracking: The system tracks user progress through enrolled courses, including current module and overall completion status.
User Profiles: Each user has a profile displaying their enrolled courses, learning progress, and achievements.
So far, our conversation has established the foundational technical guidelines for development, emphasizing clean code, functional programming, and the specified UI/UX libraries. We've also reviewed the database schema, which outlines the relationships between courses, syllabi, content items, user enrollments, and generation jobs. The existing codebase reflects these functionalities, with distinct components for authentication, course display, and user profile management, all interacting with the Supabase backend.
