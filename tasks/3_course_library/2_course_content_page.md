1. Build a responsive page layout with:
   - A clear navigation sidebar/menu for course modules and topics
   - A main content area to display selected topic content
   - A breadcrumb trail showing current location in course structure

2. Implement navigation functionality that:
   - Displays a hierarchical list of course modules and their topics
   - Highlights the currently selected topic
   - Allows collapsing/expanding of module sections
   - Persists the user's last viewed topic across sessions

3. Create a content display system that:
   - Renders markdown content with proper formatting
   - Supports common markdown elements (headers, lists, code blocks, tables)
   - Includes syntax highlighting for code snippets
   - Handles images and embedded media
   - Implements smooth transitions between topics

4. Add these user experience features:
   - Progress tracking for completed topics
   - Search functionality for topics and content
   - Responsive design that works on mobile devices
   - Clear loading states while content is being fetched
   - Option to adjust text size and theme preferences

Please provide the implementation ensuring clean code structure and proper error handling.
