Let's update app to be able to track users course progress. 
If user generates a course they should "enroll" automatically.  




Let's Update course library page. It should have 2 sections:
1. That Section with "Courses Library Coming Soon" text should instead have rows that show progress in courses users already enrolled. 
2. After that we already have some cards. Now it's time to fill them with information from courses in db. all courses in our platform are public. users can see courses generated by other useres. Cards should have "enroll" button"

Add missing DB table o track user progress. User should be able to re-enroll into the same course multiple time. 
It's important to track how far into modules user progressed. In future, we are going to lock access to the next modules until user passes exams on the prev module. Make sure to take it into account when making db schema.

For non-logged in users don't show "progress". And enroll button should redirect to login page.

For users that are not logged in - library with available courses (course conficurations from the database).
They can click "enroll" which would redirect them to signup page. After signup - should enroll. 

On top courses in progress.
