Let's add authorization and storing data in Supabase:
1. User should be able to see the main page and library page without login
    1.2 Should only be able to see profile page when logged in
2. Auth will be based on username & password
3. Provide me with the query for creating the database table
4. Store sensitive config in the .env file
5. Do you need anything from me?
