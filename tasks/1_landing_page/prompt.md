# Orion Path - Landing Page Design Specification

Create a skeleton for a modern, minimalist web app with AI-powered learning courses  generation web platform called "Orion Path". The design should focus on these key elements:

Navigation through a side bar (see attached image for layout and icons) on all pages.
Onhover sidebar expands with pages names.
Sidebar has a background.

For now only Hero Section:
   - Large, bold typography with displaying "What do you want to learn today?"
   - Organic, fluid blob animations that morph and move subtly (using #323e65 as base with #a7bfd9 highlights)
   - Text input field with animated gradient border
   - button to procced (as in mock), for now no action 
1. Couses Library page:
   - Leave blank
2. Profile page
   - leave blank

Very important to organize those pages code as independant as possible, so it would be easier to work on different parts of it with bolt. 

Additionally to thoose pages, on the bottom of the sidebar icons for dark/light theme switch and logout.
