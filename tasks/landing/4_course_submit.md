1. Discussion:

Okay, let's add submit course logic. First I will give you the context, and then we will do it step by step.
Submit saves course counfiguration to "course_configuration" table.
then edge function should pick it up, call ai to generate syllabus, and save syllabus to supabase. 
here is schema of syllabus (you should choose the most appropriate way to represent it with SQL):
Syllabus:
  course_configuration: foreign key     
  modules[]:
    summary: String  
    topics[]:
      summary: String
      keywords: String[]
      content: Big text in markdown
  keywords: String[]     

Let's come up with a plan

===> Output  
Initialize Supabase Client:

Create a new file src/lib/supabase.ts.
In this file, you will initialize the Supabase client using your Supabase project URL and anon key. These credentials should be stored as environment variables (e.g., VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY).
Define Supabase Database Schema:

You will need two tables in your Supabase project: course_configuration and syllabus.
The course_configuration table will store the user's input from the form.
The syllabus table will store the generated syllabus, utilizing a JSONB column to efficiently handle the nested modules and topics structure, as well as the keywords arrays. This syllabus table will also have a foreign key relationship to the course_configuration table.
Update LandingPage.tsx for Form Submission:

Open src/pages/landing.tsx.
Import the Supabase client you created in src/lib/supabase.ts.
Import the useToast hook from src/hooks/use-toast.ts to provide user feedback (success or error messages).
Locate the handleNext function. Inside the else block (where currentStep === 3), you will replace the console.log statement with logic to insert the formData into the course_configuration table in Supabase.
After a successful insertion, you should display a success toast message and consider resetting the form or navigating the user to another page.
Implement error handling to catch any issues during the Supabase insertion and display an appropriate error toast message.
Conceptual: Supabase Edge Function for Syllabus Generation:

After the course_configuration is successfully saved, you would typically set up a Supabase Edge Function (or a database trigger) to listen for new inserts into the course_configuration table.
This Edge Function would then call your AI model to generate the syllabus based on the configuration.
Finally, the Edge Function would save the generated syllabus (including its modules, topics, and keywords) into the syllabus table, linking it back to the course_configuration_id.
