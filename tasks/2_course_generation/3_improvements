Can we improve the flow of creating course?

When anonimus should remember course configuration, after user logs in / registers should submit course generation
After course submitted, we want to communicate that generation might take a couple of minutes, in meanwhile, users can browse existing course library.
As course being generated, it should be shown in course library as "being generated", with some animated gears
Should have "retry" button if course generation failed
Should schedule content generation for topics of the first module automatically after course syllabus is generated.
