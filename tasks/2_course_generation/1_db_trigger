Please create an edge function that will be triggered by database trigger.

High level:
When course configuration gets submitted, edge function should pick it up and call AI to generate syllabus and then update syllabus in the database.

Details:
Should use zod schema to enforse response structure
Should use appropriate AI model, for example OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4/4o.


Rules:  
- {depth}1: 3 modules, 3 topics/module, basic resources  
- {depth}5: 5 modules, 8 topics/module, academic papers + advanced tutorials  
- Resources must match depth level


-- comment: db trigger is a bit tricky to make due to secrets managements. for now, calling from UI instead.
