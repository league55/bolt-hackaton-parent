## Inspiration
Orion Path was inspired by a real challenge I encountered while learning new topics: educational materials were often either too shallow or overwhelmingly deep for my needs. For example, when researching Apache Druid database ingestion, I found the official documentation dense and hard to navigate, while AI-generated summaries were more accessible but lacked structure. This experience, combined with the concept of graded readers in language learning, led me to the idea of a platform that delivers structured, personalized learning at the right depth for any subject—Orion Path.

## Full functionality
After logging in, users can generate a course or enroll in one of the courses generated by other users.  
When the syllabus is ready, they can proceed to the library and study the text version of the course.  
They can also generate an audio version of the topic if that is their preferred way to study.  
By the end of the course, users are prompted to take a final oral knowledge assessment with an AI replica.  
Later, the transcript will be evaluated and used to generate a certificate.  
If users configure their blockchain wallet, their certificate will also be saved as a blockchain transaction.

## How I built it

### The story
The project was started and mainly developed in Bolt.  
Before starting the final version, I had a couple of practice runs, trying to create pieces of the application and practice some prompts.  
Very soon, I understood that the project needed structure, so I created a [separate repository](https://github.com/league55/bolt-hackaton-parent) for the PRD, task breakdown, and even for storing and refining my prompts.

The crazy part is that sometimes, tasks take a reasonable amount of time—I mean, "Bolt reasonable time."  
But sometimes, I would just ask to "create a content library for students to be able to read the course content," and Bolt would do weeks of work in a minute, almost exactly as I wanted it.  
Fast leaps like that freed up time for additional functionality, like the audio version of the content, Tavus for the final exam, or blockchain certificates.

### The technical part
The project consists of two applications, both created with Bolt and using the same tech stack:  
* React for the frontend  
* Supabase as a database, for authentication, jobs, webhooks, and audio file storage  
* Netlify with continuous deployment  
* Edge functions as backend  
* Deployed to https://everythinglearn.online/ domain with IONOS 
* Tavus for final AI conversations  
* ElevenLabs for text-to-speech generation  
* Algorand blockchain for certificates  

One of the more challenging parts was making functionality asynchronous: course syllabus generation, topic content generation, and many other parts are implemented as **asynchronous jobs**—inserting an item into a database

Another interesting challenge was pulling the examination transcript from Tavus after the call. The transcript was not ready immediately, but luckily, they provide webhooks with events. Wiring that up with an edge function was super easy in Bolt.

Some parts of development were super smooth—integrating Bolt with Supabase, creating authentication, and building the landing page was **almost too easy**. Here are a couple of challenges I faced:

#### Challenge 1: Learning how to describe
To get a good output, you have to describe it well. I quickly found out that I wasn't strong in design, and saying "make me a cool, modern-looking landing page" would not get me exactly what I wanted. So I literally had to take a break from the main project, study landing page design, and create a couple of "test" Bolt projects with just landing pages until I started getting results closer to my vision.

#### Challenge 2: Project got too big
At some point, the project stopped fitting into Bolt's context window, so I had to extract the "library" into a separate project and import it back into Bolt.  
It took me a day to figure out how to make smooth authentication with cookies, but we got there, and the consistency that Bolt has between projects definitely helped.


## What's next for Orion Path

The project is now very close to a usable state—I consider it ready for Beta testing.  
My next step is to share Orion Path with a wider audience to better understand what features and improvements real users need.  
Ideally, within a couple of months, I plan to integrate payment solutions like Stripe or RevenueCat and move toward an official launch.

There are also several potential directions for pivoting. For example, Orion Path could become a platform for commercial courses, allowing HR partners to generate specialized training—like an "AML course"—with AI, refine it, and offer it to their employees. In this scenario, blockchain certificate records would be especially valuable.  
However, I am committed to keeping the core learning functionality open and accessible to the public.
